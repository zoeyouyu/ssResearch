Under pressure - A visual approach.  

Doing pelvic floor muscle contraction (PFMC) exercise is an effective way to train pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and to treat stress urinary incontinence in women.

Femfit® is an intravaginal pressure device with 8 sensors.

The aim is to analyse pressure traces measured by the femfit®, using specialised coding functions created in R.

Data was transferred via Bluetooth to an iPad in a clinical study (Ref no.017618).
